This study, based on the skills acquired during the Data Analysis and Statistical Models course of the Second Level Master degree in Artificial 
Intelligence & Data Science (Unical), analyzes the coffee dataset from the R package *pgmm* with the aim of identifying groups of similar observations. 

Following a preliminary analysis of the variables and the clustering tendency, partitioning clustering, hierarchical clustering, 
and Gaussian mixture models are applied. These methods allow for the exploration of the latent structure of the data and the identification 
of relationships between groups, highlighting the main characteristics that distinguish each cluster. 

The study aims to provide an accessible overview of the data patterns, offering useful insights to understand the dynamics emerging from the dataset.
